1- You have to download node.js, so that you can launch the projects and use a command called npm: you can find the download link here: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

2- Then either by directly downloading the code or using github desktop, you pull the repository onto your computer

3- You then download visual studio code and on the left bar there's this tab called extensions, download npm from there, you can find visual studio code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

4- Once you have visual studio code and npm downloaded, you then want to open the project folder in vs code

5- You should now have all the code available on visual studio code, you then want to open three terminals within vs code and cd into the node-rest-api folder in one of the terminals, cd into socket in the second one, and then cd into the react-social folder in the third one

6- Starting with the node-rest-api one you type npm start, you then type npm add socket.io into the socket one and then type npm start into it, and finally you then type npm install react-scripts --save into the react-social one and then npm start into it as well, so that the project opens up for you

7- Everything should be set up now and you should be able to start coding and see the changes in real time. You need to repeat steps 5 and 6 every time you want to launch the project
